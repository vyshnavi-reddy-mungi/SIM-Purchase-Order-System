// Thread pool collection of pre-initialized threads that can be reused to execute tasks concurrently.
// 1. Resource management : Thread pools help in managing resources efficiently by reusing threads instead of creating new ones for each task.
// 2. Performance improvement- response time : Thread pools can improve performance by reducing the overhead of thread creation and destruction.
// 3. Control over thread count : Thread pools allow you to control the number of concurrent threads, preventing resource exhaustion.
